# Alternative visual treatments and asset direction

Use the user's brief, supplied references and established project system as authority.
The patterns here are options for the selected style, not instructions to add scope,
change a brand or introduce effects into unrelated work. Read only the relevant sections.

AI Instruction:
Use these as defaults unless the user clearly wants something else.
Adapt them to the app category.

Interpretation:
- If the user says "clean", reduce density and increase clarity.
- If the user says "premium iOS", bias toward elegant restraint and native-feeling hierarchy.
- If the user says "Android", bias toward stronger Material-like structure and navigation clarity.
- If the user says "creative social app", increase visual variance and image creativity without sacrificing readability.
- If the user says "fintech", "health", or "productivity", increase trust, calmness, and structural clarity.
- Do not be lazy with screen count.
- If more screens would make the flow better, generate more screens.
- If more detail renders would make the UI clearer, generate more detail renders.
- Default toward richer art direction than standard AI mobile output.
- Use creative assets, texture, and imagery deliberately, not randomly.
- Always keep the color palette clean, controlled, and intentional.
- Avoid generic color choices.
- Do not force every app into ultra-simple minimalism.
- Keep text comfortably readable at normal viewing size.
- Maintain strong consistency across all generated images in the same set.
- Keep device framing neat, even, and professional.
- Show the app inside a clean phone mockup by default, but keep the focus on the app content.

## 16. CREATIVE IMAGE DIRECTION RULE

This skill should be more creative than generic app UI generators.

Actively use imagery and art direction when it helps the concept.

Creative image usage may include:
- photography-led onboarding
- large editorial image blocks
- image-backed headers
- product or lifestyle imagery
- scenic or atmospheric backgrounds
- illustration-driven entry screens
- media cards with layered treatment
- bold visual covers on key screens
- image strips, shelves, or carousels
- background images partially revealed behind typography

Do not make imagery feel like an afterthought.
Do not use lazy filler thumbnails.
Use real image logic as part of the layout and mood.

When the app category supports it, prefer:
- stronger hero imagery
- more visual storytelling
- richer art direction
- more memorable image composition

---

## 17. BACKGROUND TEXTURE AND SURFACE RULE

Do not default to perfectly sterile flat backgrounds.

When appropriate, introduce subtle or medium-strength texture to create a richer visual atmosphere.

Allowed background treatments:
- soft film grain
- subtle noise
- paper-like texture
- lightly speckled surfaces
- brushed or frosted texture feel
- tonal gradient fog
- clouded ambient depth
- tactile matte surfaces
- faint grid or pattern texture
- blurred photographic background layers

Use texture to make the UI feel:
- more premium
- more tactile
- less generic
- more art-directed

But:
- keep it controlled
- keep the UI readable
- do not let heavy texture overwhelm text
- do not introduce noise just for the sake of noise

Good rule:
texture should support the mood, not compete with the interface.

---

## 18. IMAGE-BEHIND-TEXT RULE

When appropriate, use images behind or beneath text in a controlled, premium way.

Preferred treatments:
- image background under a title block with a fade to transparent
- bottom-to-top gradient fade to support text legibility
- side fade masks so text sits over the clean portion
- soft blur overlays behind text
- image partially visible behind copy, fading into the background color
- large edge-to-edge visual with a scrim under headline and CTA
- photo or illustration bleeding behind typography but gently masked

This is especially useful for:
- onboarding
- welcome screens
- media apps
- fashion / travel / lifestyle apps
- premium commerce apps
- social apps
- editorial experiences

Rules:
- text must stay readable
- the fade / mask should feel elegant
- the image should still be visually meaningful
- the treatment should feel intentional, not like random opacity

Avoid:
- raw image under text with no readability support
- muddy overlays
- too many heavy gradients
- noisy backgrounds that destroy hierarchy

---

## 19. CREATIVE ASSET RULE

Use tasteful supporting creative assets when they improve the visual language.

Allowed creative assets:
- clean micro-illustrations
- simple geometric SVG-style motifs
- tiny line-art accents
- subtle vector icons
- dotted guides
- arc shapes
- orbital lines
- tasteful starbursts
- calm abstract marks
- mini diagram-like elements
- product-relevant iconography
- clean sticker-like accent elements when suitable

These assets should feel:
- clean
- premium
- restrained
- integrated into the design system
- supportive, not distracting

Do not:
- spam random stickers
- clutter the interface with decorative icons
- add meaningless SVG art
- use childish doodles unless the brand clearly wants it

A few clean visual accents are good.
Too many become noise.

---

## 20. ICONOGRAPHY RULE

Do not default to generic developer-style icon packs or bland Lucide-like icon vibes.

Avoid:
- generic line-icon defaults that make the app feel like a template
- overused developer-tool icon language
- icons that feel too plain, too open-source-default, or too undifferentiated
- randomly mixing icon weights and styles

Prefer:
- a clean custom-feeling icon system
- restrained, brand-appropriate iconography
- consistent stroke or filled logic
- icons with slightly more character when the concept allows it
- product-specific icon decisions instead of default library-looking symbols

Icons should feel:
- clean
- intentional
- premium
- integrated
- not generic

## 23. COLOR PALETTE RULE

Always use a clean, controlled color palette.

Color should feel:
- intentional
- premium
- coherent
- non-generic
- visually calm even when expressive

Rules:
- use a strong palette with internal logic
- keep color relationships clean
- let one or two accents do real work
- avoid muddy, accidental, or chaotic color combinations
- avoid generic startup gradients unless they truly fit
- avoid default purple-blue AI palettes unless specifically justified
- avoid random bright rainbow color use
- avoid throwing many unrelated saturated colors together
- keep saturation under control unless the brand clearly benefits from stronger intensity

A palette can be:
- bold
- soft
- dark
- editorial
- playful
- luxurious
- atmospheric

But it must still feel clean.

Good color direction should make the app feel:
- distinctive
- art-directed
- brand-specific
- expensive or thoughtfully designed

Not:
- template-like
- random
- overcooked
- generic

---

## 24. NON-GENERICITY RULE

The app should not feel like a default template.

Do not settle for:
- standard generic fintech
- standard wellness pastel app
- standard social feed clone
- standard productivity dashboard clone
- standard ecommerce browse/detail clone without personality

Push the concept toward:
- stronger identity
- stronger mood
- stronger art direction
- cleaner but more original composition
- better image treatment
- more distinctive asset language
- more specific palette logic
- more memorable screen-to-screen rhythm

The result should feel like:
- a real designed product
not:
- a reusable starter template with better lighting

---

## 25. NOT usually SIMPLE RULE

Do not force every app into hyper-minimal simplicity.

Simplicity is not the goal by itself.
Cleanliness is the goal.

This means:
- a screen may be rich, layered, and expressive if it remains readable
- a flow may have stronger visuals, texture, and more atmosphere if it stays structured
- an app may use bold imagery, richer backgrounds, and more art direction without becoming messy

Allowed:
- sophisticated layering
- controlled visual depth
- richer compositions
- stronger image presence
- decorative accents with purpose
- multiple visual zones within a screen
- more character when the brand needs it

Not allowed:
- noisy complexity
- clutter disguised as creativity
- random decorative overload
- muddy hierarchy
- unreadable interfaces

The rule is:
not always simple  
always clean

---

## 26. IMAGE SYSTEM RULE

Images are not mandatory on every app screen, but when they appear they must feel important.

Use images when the app category benefits from them:
- social
- ecommerce
- travel
- wellness
- editorial
- food
- fashion
- content apps
- creator apps
- marketplace apps

Types of image usage:
- onboarding hero visuals
- profile imagery
- product imagery
- collection thumbnails
- editorial crops
- photo-led cards
- cover blocks
- media shelves
- gallery strips
- background images under text with fade treatments
- softly masked image headers
- atmospheric scene layers behind core content

Rules:
- image usage should match the app category
- repeated image modules should use controlled proportions
- images should feel curated and consistent
- the app should not rely on one single image if the flow clearly needs more
- different screens can use different images, but they must still belong to one product world
- if imagery is important, push it hard enough to feel intentional

Avoid:
- random filler thumbnails
- one pretty screen and then no imagery at all
- inconsistent image proportions
- collage chaos unless explicitly requested

---

## 27. FIXED MOBILE MEDIA FRAME RULE

When images are used, place them inside clear, controlled frames.

Prefer:
- stable aspect ratios
- consistent crop behavior
- repeatable media modules
- clear radius logic
- clean framing

Examples:
- onboarding hero in a bounded visual block
- product cards with consistent proportions
- editorial shelves with repeatable crops
- profile/media headers with stable framing
- image rows with controlled ratios

Avoid:
- random image sizes
- messy scaling
- inconsistent crop systems
- uncontrolled visual noise

The goal is strong media inside a believable mobile system.
